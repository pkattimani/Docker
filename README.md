# Custom Apache Docker Image

## Project Overview
This project aims to Dockerize an Apache application on an Ubuntu base image. The Docker image is built from scratch, installs the necessary dependencies, and deploys a simple HTML page. The final Docker image is then pushed to DockerHub for easy access and deployment.

## Features
- **Custom Apache Installation**: Uses an Ubuntu base image and installs Apache HTTP Server.
- **Static HTML Content**: Serves a simple HTML page using Apache.
- **DockerHub Integration**: Includes a script to push the Docker image to DockerHub.
